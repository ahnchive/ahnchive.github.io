The research projects that I'm currently interested in and working on:

# The role of top-down object reconstruction in object perception
Humans need to interact with objects, so evolution endowed us with a visual system that constantly attempts to reconstructs the familar or meaningful objects; the proverbial bunny in a cloud! This project explores how and to what extent this top-down object reconstruction is functionally used for object recognition, grouping, and attention. We are using generative, object-centric approach to study this problem.

# How language and vision interact? 

Multi-modal pre-training models have been intensively explored to bridge vision and language in recent years.

# Mental State Prediction from Eye Movements 
Can we decode someone's mental states just from their eye movements? In this project, we attempt to pr
readerâ€™s eye movements in real time to predict their mental states, specifically: level of text comprehension, difficulty, and sleepiness
