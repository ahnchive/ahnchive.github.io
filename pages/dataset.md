#### COCO Search-18


COCO-Search18 is a high-quality dataset of eye gaze behavior during goal-directed search in natural-scene images. It includes eye movements from 10 participants searching for 18 target-object categories, yielding approximately 300,000 search fixations. COCO-Search18 is part of the [MIT/Tuebingen Saliency Benchmark](https://saliency.tuebingen.ai/). You can download the training and validation search fixations for COCO-Search18 from [here](https://sites.google.com/view/cocosearch/).

#### SB-SAT
SB-SAT is a high-quality eye gaze dataset of reading behavior that includes eye movements recorded from 95 individuals reading four published SAT passages. Each passage is followed by corresponding SAT questions and self-evaluation questionnaires that measure engagement, sleepiness, and other factors. You can download all recorded fixation and response data from [here](https://github.com/ahnchive/SB-SAT).
